# Bag chair detection model

Machine learning lives here :robot:

Iâ€™m going to train an object detector to detect free and occupied bagchairs in an image or video for [sandbags monitor project](https://github.com/a1usha/NSU_project_v2.0). For this purpose, I will use the deep learning technique called [Transfer learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_learning#:~:text=Transfer%20learning%20(TL)%20is%20a,when%20trying%20to%20recognize%20trucks.) with help of [Tensorflow Object Detection API](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection).

What is Transfer Learning
---
In most cases, training a convolutional neural network is a difficult and time-consuming process that requires a lot of **computing power** and **data**. In modern realities, both components are quite possible to find - [ImageNet](http://www.image-net.org/) (or others) as data library and [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) (or others) as power. However, the use of cloud computations can cost the user a pretty penny. 

Therefore, in order to speed up the process and save the wallet, people use **transfer learning**: use already trained (mostly called pre-trained) convolution network as the starting point for their own model (use pre-trained weights as the initial weights for own model). 

The whole process can be divided into three large steps (however, this is how any model training works):

- Collect data - This may already be data collected by someone (as ImageNet) or data received manually (this is my case, I have not found large collections of images of bagchairs other than those that can be found in Google Images).

- Annotate the data - In short, it is the process of marking the location of objects and specifying their classes in the data.

- Fine-tune the net - Re-train the weights of the ConvNet using regular [backpropagation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation).


Tensorflow object detection API
---
Not so far ago, Tensorflow developers made available an Object Detection API for simplifying process of fine-tuning of a pre-trained model. API is provided as a set of scripts, which with minor modifications can be used for your own purposes.

Next, I will describe my own experience and approach to using the above methods.

1) I **collected images** and **annotated** them. There are several tools for annotating dataset that can be found on the Internet - I used [MakeSence](https://www.makesense.ai/). It is important to note that there are several annotation formats - COCO, Pascal VOC and YOLO. The code in the future will also depend on the chosen format. I used Pascal VOC, it stores annotation in XML file. Also, you should create label map file (.pbtxt) for future processing.
```
<annotation>
	<folder>images</folder>
	<filename>image0.jpg</filename>
	<path>download_data/downloads/images/image0.jpg</path>
	<source>
		<database>Unspecified</database>
	</source>
	<size>
		<width>522</width>
		<height>481</height>
		<depth>3</depth>
	</size>
	<object>
		<name>occupied_bagchair</name>
		<pose>Unspecified</pose>
		<truncated>Unspecified</truncated>
		<difficult>Unspecified</difficult>
		<bndbox>
			<xmin>4</xmin>
			<ymin>2</ymin>
			<xmax>521</xmax>
			<ymax>479</ymax>
		</bndbox>
	</object>
</annotation>
```

pascal_label_map.pbtxt file
```
item {
  id: 1
  name: 'empty_bagchair'
}

item {
  id: 2
  name: 'occupied_bagchair'
}
```

2) **Create TF Records**. I took the [script](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/dataset_tools/create_pascal_tf_record.py) from the API as a basis and changed it a little (rather, simplified it). It is worth mentioning why this format is needed - TFRecord is Tensorflow's own binary storage format, using it for storage of dataset can have significant impact on performance of import pipeline and for training in future. More info: [Tensorflow Records? What they are and how to use them](https://medium.com/mostly-ai/tensorflow-records-what-they-are-and-how-to-use-them-c46bc4bbb564)

```
python create_tfrecords_from_xml.py ^
    --image_dir=data\images ^
    --annotations_dir=data\annotations ^
    --label_map_path=data\label_map\pascal_label_map.pbtxt ^
    --output_path=tf_data\bagchair.record
```
